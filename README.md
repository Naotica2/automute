Hello, this is a script for the Skript plugin, not YML or JSON coding!  

### **How does this script work?**  
When a player types a bad word that is in the **bad words list**, they will get muted.  

**How long?**  
It depends on what you set in the `execute console command` section. Since this script sets it to **30 minutes**, the player will be muted for 30 minutes.  

Also, **donâ€™t forget to install the SkBee and EssentialsX plugin!**  

Bye!
